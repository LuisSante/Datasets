com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Great app! The new version now works on my Bravia Android TV which is great as it's right by my rooftop aerial cable. The scan feature would be useful...any ETA on when this will be available? Also the option to import a list of bookmarks e.g. from a simple properties file would be useful.,October 12 2016,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Great It's not fully optimised and has some issues with crashing but still a nice app  especially considering the price and it's open source.,August 23 2016,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works on a Nexus 6p I'm still messing around with my hackrf but it works with my Nexus 6p  Trond usb-c to usb host adapter. Thanks!,August 04 2016,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,The bandwidth seemed to be limited to maximum 2 MHz or so. I tried to increase the bandwidth but not possible. I purchased this is because one of the pictures in the advertisement showed the 2.4GHz band with around 10MHz or more bandwidth. Is it not possible to increase the bandwidth? If not  it is just the same performance as other free APPs.,July 25 2016,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works well with my Hackrf Hopefully new updates will arrive for extra functions,July 22 2016,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Good job Tried a few . This has to be the most stable and best to my liking . And a whole world of settings to play with. However we are quite limited on frequency band width id like to see it lowered to 14.mhz if possible,July 19 2016,5

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Very nice. Great UI  works like a charm. If you have an NVIDIA shield  try spamming the connect/play button.,September 25 2015,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Additional info Used it w/RTL-SDR (R820T) on my phone (Moto G) also and it works great there too. I already had FM on this phone and now have NWS  taxis  Aviation  Marine  etc. Hopefully scanner update soon. Love it! Have it also on my new Chuwi HI8 dual-mode tablet so you can add that to the list ,September 25 2015,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Fun app - A little tedious though I enjoy using this app but can be a bit tedious trying to get everything set and configured just right. Once your SDR dongle has been properly configured you can then enjoy using it. Nice little app :&gt;),September 24 2015,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,"Works Great. Works great on a 2015 Medion Lifetab S10346 (MD99282). 10.1"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Android 5. Watson wideband 100Khz-2Ghz model W-SDRX1 rtl dongle based receiver. Mostly Amatuer Band and Airband use. HF and VHF-UHF receive is fine if you cn feed it from any half decent antenna farm  even works ok with indoor antenna systems with a bit more interference. It is possible to power the receiver from the tablet with the supplied usb otg cable but a otg cable with power in capablity is highly recommended. Great app  works as good as any windows  linux or mac sdr apps that I own. Fine Business to the developer. Wish that I could rate your app with more than 5 stars  makes it possible for me to go portable or mobile with the sdr without having to carry a laptop everywhere.""""",September 03 2015,5

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Amazing A very useful app. I originally downloaded the free version from github  but decided to buy it here as the dev deserves the money.,August 10 2015,5

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Very useful Works as shown,March 24 2015,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Awesome work - thanks for open sourcing! So happy to discover this project. Thank you so much for the first GPL open source Android sdr spectrum explorer I've seen. Very exciting. It's also great that you've made it easy to put a $ in the tip jar via the app store. I'm really jazzed about RF Explorer! Keep up the great work! Other features it would be wonderful to see in future versions (these would be icing on the cake!): - DC offset correction - Audio gain control - (maybe even audio spectrum display?),March 21 2015,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Amazing!!! Works like a charm! Nice feature to save recordings into file. Would be even better to transmit from file on HackRF! 73 SQ7MHZ,March 20 2015,5

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Excellent job This app works great. No head aches   no yelling. I followed the instructions  downloaded the driver. My rtlsdr worked not a single problem. I can't get any rtlsdr to work on my desk tops. Thank you oh great one!,January 19 2015,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works Great App works well with rtl-sdr usb dongle except that it has a much more restricted freq range than a competitors app with the same dongle. Possibly a user error. Ie can not tune below 24Mhz. Get out of range error. Hoping this is user error as the support and upgrade path from this dev appears to be much better than competitors app. UPDATE: After response from Dev. it appears that the app is correct the tuner in my dongle has a24MHz lower limit  The competitors app appears to tune much lower ( doesn't throw error and has signals) but it is not actually tuning lower. After purchase support for this app is superb. Can't wait for future updates. Thank You,January 19 2015,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Excellent app Works great on my Note 8.0 and with a powered micro-usb-hub works on my Z3 compact too. Looking forward to scanning and would love to see audio recording added. Thanks :-),January 07 2015,5

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Superb on Tesco Hudl 2 Worked first time with RTL dongle and pre-installed driver from Martin Marinov,January 01 2015,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Definitely worth $0.99 Only $0.99! Since the developer is quickly listening to user feedback - this app is probably going to be better than SDR Touch very soon! I have two wishes - Material Design  and remove the screen orientation settings to use Android's settings. Update: one of those wishes has already come true! The logo and name of the app is missing from the top right corner  though.,December 10 2014,5

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Crashes with in 10 seconds I cant even use this for more then 15 seconds,December 25 2016,1
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Squelch is non-existent in this app. The developer claims it exists but it is impossible to set up. No matter how I adjust the gain I always hear the RF noise in between the transmissions. This app will make me deaf. The only way to eliminate the noise is to manually move the dB slider up and down which very impractical and annoying. Every free PC SDR software has perfectly working squelch. Why this one doesn't? Could be a great app but luck of squelch makes it unusable. I would expect this to be fixed.,February 12 2017,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works well on Huawei Mediapad ML-802L and RTL,February 12 2017,5
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,For €0.79 this app is 10x less expensive than sdr touch and for that reason I gave it four stars. There are some improvements needed such as setting squelch and bandwidth could be easier  recording audio as well as the entire band  there is a high-pitched tone when using wide band fm  a way that makes it easier to fine tune and stability improvements. This app works pretty well on my device (OnePlus 2) but it does crash every now and then (when changing between portrait and landscape for example). I think this app is great for the price and does pretty much everything I need but I would like to see these improvements.,February 20 2017,4

com.pilot51.voicenotify,Good app but desperately needs updating!!! Has not kept up with the latest Android versions since Jelly Bean. Where's the support for extended notification text??? This is the reason for many of the comments about notifications from certain apps not being spoken. No response from Pilot_51 to any comments here. App appears to be abandon-ware. Outdated.,September 03 2016,2

com.pilot51.voicenotify,Please fix it. Aside from that this app fails to read the entire contents of the message whether that's the stock messaging app or third party like Telegram for example only a few lines are read. Are our credit cards really safe turning this on? Please fix it so the entire text message reads out loud not just the first few words. LG G3 stick ROM 5.1.1.,May 26 2016,2

com.pilot51.voicenotify,Fantastic app! I highly recommend it! 'Voice Notify' is an essential app for anyone  but especially useful for someone such as myself who has dexterity difficulties  also has a SCI & is a fulltime wheelchair user. I do not have to look at my phone to know what is happening. VN is very customisable  eg  you can stop some FB group messages by putting the group name or a word in the 'ignored text' option in VN settings. Wish 'Email' said who was sending the emails like 'Gmail' does. Unfortunately on my new Note4  VN keeps being 'disabled'!?! Such a pain for an essential app! ?,January 02 2016,5
com.pilot51.voicenotify,Fantastic app! When I connect my BT headset  I have it set to read important notifications - add that to Google Now's ability to create texts  reminders and calendar events  and my $20 headset has all the functionality of a smartwatch.

com.pilot51.voicenotify,"Excellent and very useful app. Works perfectly. I especially like that you can specify which of your phone's apps VN will speak for. Suggestions/comments: 1) Would be nice if it could also say caller's names. 2) And if the widget changed colour (and shape?) when VN is turned off. ...p.s. Just realised it does seem to change colour but for those of us who are colour-blind  we need a much clearer change please. ...maybe from primary red or yellow when """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""on"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to greyed out when """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""off"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Thanks. 2) YouTube alerts don't seem to be read although YouTube is set to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""not ignored"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". 3) It would be nice to display """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Run VN yes/no?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" on power-up.
